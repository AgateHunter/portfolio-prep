# Portfolio Prep
Comprehensive portfolio for Natalie Stone

## Overview
In the first module of this course, you will build a personal portfolio site. This will help you establish a home on the web, and show off some of your software development projects and skills.
Sometimes, the hardest part is getting the words right. To help you prepare for building your portfolio, you can start thinking about what you want to say now.

To find some inspiration, check out these snapshots of a student’s completed portfolio:

- About Page

## Tell me about yourself

Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

### A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.

### A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

### Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

There is something unique about the ability to transform lines of code into the most imagnitive applications, designed to solve the problems of the world. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.

## Gather your assets

A few punchy images will really help your page stand out, and make it your own. Gather images for the following:
.
#### A headshot of your wonderful face, approximately 200x250 pixels.
