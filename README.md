# Portfolio Prep
Comprehensive portfolio for Natalie Stone

## Overview
In the first module of this course, you will build a personal portfolio site. This will help you establish a home on the web, and show off some of your software development projects and skills.
Sometimes, the hardest part is getting the words right. To help you prepare for building your portfolio, you can start thinking about what you want to say now.

## Tell me about yourself

Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

### A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.

### A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

### Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.
 
Hello, I'm Natalie Stone, a dedicated software developer with a purpose of amplifying access and opportunities through purposeful code. Equipped with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology, a Master's degree in Student Affairs Administration, and certifications as a Project Management and Change Management Professional.

My journey spans over 15 years in higher education, and over 21 years in the Army National Guard, where I served as a musician prior to retiring. Whether it's solving problems or fostering creativity, I've witnessed firsthand the impact of software applications. This realization ignited my passion to be on the frontlines of creation, contributing to solutions that address the needs of often overlooked populations.

I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and a deep understanding of diverse communities, making me not just a software developer but a bridge between technology and societal needs. Let’s explore how intentional code can be a catalyst for positive change.
